-2 Your tagged commit did not have a lang.l. I graded your final commit instead.

-5 You did not report an error if the file did not have and 'end'

The END_OF_FILE definition probably should have gone in tokens.h instead of parse.cpp

-1 Your error recovery process in FindSTMT was more convoluted than necessary.
